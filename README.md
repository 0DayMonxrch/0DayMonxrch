I'm a computer science undergraduate specialising in cybersecurity. I'm currently building expertise in penetration testing, network defence, and malware analysis using tools like Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Wireshark. I’m actively learning via TryHackMe and Hack The Box and running my own home lab.

Passionate about ethical hacking, red team techniques, and staying ahead of cyber threats. My goal is to contribute to advanced cybersecurity systems and eventually lead innovative research in AI-powered security.

Let’s connect if you’re into cybersecurity, tech, or building something that changes the game.
